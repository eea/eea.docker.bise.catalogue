# How to create, delete and restore 

The ElasticSearch in production is currently configured with a 
snapshots repository at /snapshots/, which is mapped to the
snapshots folder in the dockerized folder.

$ curl -XGET 'http://10.0.30.44:9200/_snapshot/backup?pretty'
{
  "backup" : {
    "type" : "fs",
    "settings" : {
      "compress" : "true",
      "location" : "/snapshots/"
    }
  }
}

You can create a new snapshot:
curl -XPUT 'http://10.0.30.44:9200/_snapshot/backup/snapshot_2?wait_for_completion=true'

You can list the snapshots:
$ curl -XGET 'http://10.0.30.44:9200/_snapshot/backup/_all'

The snapshots will be created in the eea.docker.bise.catalogue/snapshots/ folder

Make a tgz of that folder and upload it to another server:

cd eea.docker.bise.catalogue
$ tar czf snapshots.tgz snapshots/
scp snapshots.tgz ip:/var/local/eea.docker.bise.catalogue

# on the other server, in the proper location:
$ tar xzf snapshots.tgz

Make sure the snapshots content is unpacked to the
eea.docker.bise.catalogue/snapshots/ folder. This folder should now have a file
"index" and folders and files about the contained snapshots.

You should create the backup location on the new ES servers:

$ curl -XPUT 'http://10.0.30.44:9200/_snapshot/backup' -d '{
    "type": "fs",
    "settings": {
        "location": "/snapshots",
        "compress": true
    }
}'

Now you can verify that the snapshot is located by the ES server:

$ curl -XGET 'http://10.0.30.44:9200/_snapshot/backup/_all/'

You should see JSON information about the snapshot_1 and its indexes.

You can restore the snapshot (note that you have to close the existing indexes
first, if they would be overwritten), use ES Head for that,
http://10.0.30.44:9200/_plugin/head

$ curl -XPOST 'http://10.0.30.44:9200/_snapshot/backup/snapshot_1/_restore

The ElasticSearch server will now open the indexes, it will take some time for
them to sync.
